-- INDEXES-----
-- IN REAL TIME DATA WILL BE HUGE TO GENERATE OUTPUT THE SYS WILL TAKE TIME TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE CREATE INDEX FOR THOSE COLUMNS WHICH WE USE MORE...  
-- WE USE INDEXES TO GET THE SEARCH RESULT FATSER..BUT SQL HAS SEQUENTIAL SEARCH IE IT WILL CHECK ROW BY ROW WHEN WE WANT ANYTHING EX:SALARY >5000
-- ** WE WILL CREATE INDEXES TO THOSE COLUMN WHICH WE USE MORE FOR APPLYING CONDITION...WE WILL NOT CREATE INDEXES FOR THOSE COLUMN WHICH WE DO NOT USE MORE BCZ INDEXES TAKE SPACE IN DATA BASE.
-- THE DEFAULT TYPE OF INDEX GENERATED BY MYSQL IS BINARY TREE(BTREE) BCZ THE STORAGE ENGINE OF MYSQL IS INNODB.. LIKE WE DATA TYPE IN PYTHON HERE TYPE OF INDEX IS BTREE..
-- THE COLUMNS WHICH HAS PRIMARY KEY CONSTARINT THE SYS WILL GENERATED INDEX FOR THOSE COLUMNS IT IS BYDEFAULT .THIS TYPE OF INDEX IS CALLED CLUSTRED INDEX..
-- ANY COLUMN WHICH DO NOT HAVE PRIMARY KEY CONSTRAINT IF WE CREATED A INDEX FOR THAT COLUMN THIS TYPE OF INDEX IS CALLED NON CLUSTRED OR SECONDARY INDEXS...
-- IF WE CREATED INDEX FOR COLUMN THE SYS AUTOMETICLY SETS A KEY VALUE FOR EVERY COLUMN SO WHEN WE WANT BASED ON CONDITION THE SYS DIRECTLY GET THAT ROWS...

USE HR;

SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES;

-- TO SEE INDEXS OF A TABLE USE;
SHOW INDEX FROM EMPLOYEES;

-- TO CREATE INDEX USE;
CREATE INDEX NEW_1 ON EMPLOYEES(FIRST_NAME,LAST_NAME);

SHOW INDEX FROM EMPLOYEES;

-- TO DROP INDEX WHICH WE CREATED USE;
ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEES DROP INDEX NEW_1;
SHOW INDEX FROM EMPLOYEES;


-- IF THERE IS SENARIOU THAT WEW WILL USE TWO COLUMNS FOR SEARCHING ANY THING/IF WE ARE APPLYING CONDITION ON TWO COLUMNS AT A TIME WE CAN CREATE A UNIQUE INDEX FOR
-- BOTH COLUMNS TO GET RESULT FAST ON SCREEN..

-- TO CREATE UNIQUE INDEX USE;
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX NEW_1 ON EMPLOYEES(FIRST_NAME,LAST_NAME);

SHOW INDEX FROM EMPLOYEES;

-- TO DROP INDEX WHICH WE CREATED USE;
ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEES DROP INDEX NEW_1;
SHOW INDEX FROM EMPLOYEES;

SHOW INDEX FROM EMPLOYEES;


-- VIEWS...
-- VIEWS ARE TEMPARARY TABLES..
-- VIEWS ARE PART OF MAIN TABLE.. 
-- WHEN EVER I RESTRICT THE USAGE OF COLUMNS FOR A PARTICULAR PERSON .I SIMPLY GO AHEAD AND GIVE THE ACCESS OF VIEW..

-- TO CREATE A VIEW USE:-
CREATE VIEW DUMMY AS (SELECT FIRST_NAME,LAST_NAME,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES);

SELECT * FROM DUMMY;

CREATE VIEW DUMMY2 AS SELECT FIRST_NAME,LAST_NAME,JOB_ID,SALARY,MANAGER_ID FROM EMPLOYEES;

SELECT * FROM DUMMY2;
-- TO SEE VIEWS USE:
SELECT VIEW_CATALOG,VIEW_NAME,VIEW_SCHEMA FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEW_TABLE_USAGE WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='HR' AND TABLE_NAME='EMPLOYEES';

-- TO ALTER VIEW USE:
ALTER VIEW DUMMY AS (SELECT FIRST_NAME,LAST_NAME,JOB_ID,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES);
SELECT * FROM DUMMY;

-- TO DROP A VIEW USE:
DROP VIEW DUMMY;

SELECT * FROM DUMMY;

-- TO RENAME VIEW...
RENAME TABLE DUMMY2 TO DUMMY3;

-- IF WANT TO REPLACE A VIEW USE:
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW DUMMY AS (SELECT LAST_NAME,SALARY FROM EMPLOYEES);

SELECT* FROM DUMMY;

-- OR REPLACE IS USE WHEN WE WANT TO REPLACE ANYTHING LIKE TABLE,VIEW.. WITH SAME NAME WITH SOME CHANGES..
